## Programming for Data Analysis - Assignment 2020
## Due: last commit on or before November 22nd, 2020

Undergraduate of Computing (Data Analytics) at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. This repository contains the assignment instructions for the for the ``Programming for Data Analysis`` module in 2020. The assessment is worth 50% of the marks for the module. Completed the four tasks in a single [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/E6985/pda-numpy-random/blob/master/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment-2020.ipynb) 

#### Marking Scheme
1. ``25%`` - Research - Investigation of the package as demonstrated by references, background information, and approach.

2. ``25%`` - Development - Clear, well-written, and efficient code with appropriate comments.

3. ``25%`` - Consistency - Good planning and pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by commit history.

4. ``25%`` - Documentation - Concise descriptions and plots of theoretical and practical aspects of problems.

#### Getting Started
- Keeping in mind the impression given to someone who is looking at this repository, this submission is to provide direct evidence of each of the items listed in each category - ``Research`` - ``Development`` - ``Consistency`` - ``Documentation`` - refer ``Marking Scheme`` above.

1. Research:

	- ***Investigation of the package as demonstrated by references, background information, and approach***: Each topic/section will have its own ``Reference`` area - topic/section 1 will be referenced as ``1.?`` - topic/section 2 will be referenced as ``2.?`` - and so on. Where possible references will be in the format:

		- [task-number.number] authorNames, referenceTitle, locationWebsiteBookVideo, dateMonthYear.

	- Demonstrating work completed in the submission with good references and not just for the problem but for level of understanding of the problem.

	- Code comments will include details of package, module, function, object, method, attribute if applicable to demonstrate understanding of software documentation and libraries used.

2. Development:

	- ***Clear, well-written, and efficient code with appropriate comments***: Using Jupyter Notebook markdown cells to summarise concise workings. 

	- Individual code statements will have single Jupyter Notebook code cell unless user-defined functions are created. 

	- As much as possible use ``Style Guide for Python Code`` [Guido van Rossum](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029095211/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). User-defined coding conventions to be given separate section - refer ``Coding Conventions`` - within README as and when presented (note good commits do not change many different files - when a user-defined coding convention is represented within a Jupyter Notebook then the commit completed will include an update to this README file - this will be the only time this will happen given that to update README every time is wasteful):- 

3. Consistency:

	- ***Good planning and pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by commit history***: This README will form the template for this and all future tasks/projects. Git commit to include within the blurb the number of days outstanding before deadline.

	- Endeavour to submit work every day worthy of a git commit. At best 4/5 times per week. Later presentation of topics/sections will require more commits to ensure equal proof of work for all before the deadline.

	- Correctly use git history by putting in a little blurb - 2/3 lines. 

	- Commits to highlight changes made since the last commit so that reviews of the git history can demonstrate compartmentation of work into the different sections.   

4. Documentation - 

	- ***Concise descriptions and plots of theoretical and practical aspects of problems***: Comments to be very concise for ease of readability. 

	- Descriptions of code requiring further explanation will be presented in Jupyter Notebook markdown cells prior to code execution.   

#### Considerations

- The four listed categories - ``Research`` - ``Development`` - ``Consistency`` - ``Documentation`` - are each worth 25%. 

- Designed not only to be about programming but also about looking at information - data - manipulating the data and coming up with techniques. 

- Sometimes the most complex algorithms are counter-intuitive but do work and have been proven to work. Sometimes only a few lines of code is required to complete a topic/section but to obtain full marks it is not good enough to submit the lines of code. Must explain how the algorithm was developed and the reasoning behind why/how the code works.

- Jupyter Notebook text formatting/presentation to be tidied up closer to the deadline.

#### Coding Conventions

- ``Getting Started`` > ``Development``
